                    <h2>Niagara Falls, New York</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Niagara Falls. My father was stationed
                    there until I was a year and half. I have no 
                    memory of living there, so i would like to visit 
                    someday. </p>

                    <h2>Misawa Air Base, Japan</h2>
                    <p>I moved to Misawa Air Base when I was a 
                    year and a half. it is located up north of
                    the main island. I moved to different 
                    buildings in the base, but I didn't move 
                    out of the base for 7 years. I had to move 
                    away when I was almost 9 and leaving Misawa 
                    was one of the hardest things for me to do.</p>

                    <h2>Belleville, Illinois</h2>
                    <p>My family had to live in Belleville for 
                    about a year when my dad was stationed 
                    at Scott Air Force Base. We had to wait 
                    for housing on base to open up. They were 
                    building SWIC across the street when I 
                    was living in Belleville. So much has 
                    changed since i lived there.</p>

                    <h2>Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</h2>
                    <p>My family lived at Scott Air Force Base for 
                    a few years. As I grew up here, I started 
                    to like living here. I didn't want to leave 
                    the friends that I have made. So my dad decided 
                    to retire at Scott in 2005.</p>

                    <h2>Mascoutah, Illinois</h2>
                    <p>After my father retired from the Air Force, 
                    we moved to Mascoutah. I was already going 
                    to school in Mascoutah, so it made sense for 
                    our family to move there. This is the town I 
                    still live in. </p>
